Insurance Premium Proposal & Competitive Pricing Analysis
Group Employee Insurance (Workers’ Compensation, Loss of License, Leisure Accident)
Project Overview

This project develops a premium proposal for a large collaboration of companies requiring employee insurance coverage against miscellaneous personal injuries. The analysis covers Workers’ Compensation, Loss of License, and Leisure Accident insurance products and is based on historical claims experience and employee exposure data.

The project replicates a real-world non-life insurance pricing tender, combining actuarial risk premium estimation with competitive benchmarking to produce a transparent and commercially viable insurance offer.

Objectives

Estimate pure risk premiums per employee for each insurance product.

Convert pure premiums into gross premiums using explicit cost and margin assumptions.

Benchmark pricing against competitors with higher operating costs.

Produce a single aggregated premium proposal for the collaboration.

Data Sources

Claims statistics (2007–2017)

Product type (Workers’ Compensation, Loss of License, Leisure Accident)

Ultimate claim cost (paid + remaining reserve)

Employee exposure data (annual headcount)

Pricing assumptions

Competitor cost ratio: 15%

Competitor target margin: 5%

Our cost ratio: 7%

Our margin: 5%

Pricing headcount: 16,224 employees (last known period)

Methodology

Claims Experience Analysis
Claims were filtered to the 2007–2017 period and aggregated by product. Claim costs were measured on an ultimate basis to reflect expected total losses.

Pure Premium Calculation
Product-level pure premiums were calculated by dividing total claim costs by total employee exposure (employee-years).

Gross Premium & Competitive Benchmarking
Pure premiums were grossed up using competitor and company-specific cost and margin assumptions, enabling direct comparison of per-employee and annual premiums.

Final Premium Proposal
Per-employee gross premiums were multiplied by the last known employee count to derive the final annual premium offer.

Key Results
Product	Pure Premium (NOK)	Our Gross Premium (NOK)	Annual Premium (NOK)
Leisure Accident	386	439	7,116,436
Loss of License	3,498	3,975	64,490,400
Workers’ Compensation	1,111	1,263	20,482,800
Total			92,089,536
Competitor Comparison
	Competitor	Our Proposal
Total Annual Premium	NOK 101.3m	NOK 92.1m
Customer Saving		≈ NOK 9.2m (≈9%)

The pricing advantage is driven entirely by a lower operating cost ratio, while maintaining the same margin level as competitors.

Key Takeaways

Loss of License is the dominant driver of risk premium.

Operational efficiency enables a materially lower customer price without reducing coverage.

The final proposal delivers transparent, experience-based pricing aligned with real-world insurance tender practices.
